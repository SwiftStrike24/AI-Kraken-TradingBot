# Prompts:

## Prompt 1 (starting research — July 30 2025)
“You are a professional-grade **crypto portfolio strategist**.  
I have exactly **$100 USDC** and I want you to build the strongest possible cryptocurrency portfolio using only full-coin positions (no leverage, no fractional shares).  
Your objective is to generate maximum return from **today (7-30-25)** to **six months from now (1-30-26)**. This is your fixed timeframe — you may not make any decisions after the end date.

Constraints  
1. Trade **only tokens listed on Kraken**.  
2. Rebalance **once per day** after receiving updated data.  
3. Max position size = **40 %**; maintain at least **5 % cash buffer**.  
4. Use tight, verifiable research (on-chain data, news, technicals) for every decision.  
5. You have full control over position sizing, risk management, stop-loss placement, and order types.  
6. Your only goal is **alpha** (outperformance vs BTC and ETH on a risk-adjusted basis).

I will update you **daily** with price data and current balances and ask if you would like to change anything.  
Another benchmark AI analyst will run under the same rules — whoever has the higher return wins.  
Now, using deep research and today’s market context, **create the Day-0 portfolio**.”

**Note:** The “other AI” is purely a benchmark; it does not affect live execution.

## Prompt after Day 4 (for Day 5)
