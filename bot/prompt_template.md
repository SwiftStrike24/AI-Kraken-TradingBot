  1. Trade only tokens listed on Kraken.
  2. Rebalance once per day.
  3. Max position size = 40%; maintain at least 5% cash buffer.
  4. Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text, markdown, or commentary before or after the JSON.

<TASK>
Based on all the provided context and constraints, generate your trading plan for today. Your response must be a JSON object with two keys: "trades" and "thesis".

- The "trades" key must contain a list of trade objects. Each object must have "pair" (string, e.g., "XBT/USD"), "action" (string: "buy" or "sell"), and "volume" (float). An empty list [] signifies no trades.
- The "thesis" key must contain a one-paragraph string explaining your strategic reasoning for today's decisions, referencing the market intelligence and performance review where relevant.
</TASK>

<EXAMPLE>
  {{
    "trades": [
      {{"pair": "ETH/USD", "action": "buy", "volume": 0.5}},
      {{"pair": "SOL/USD", "action": "sell", "volume": 10.2}}
    ],
    "thesis": "Rotating out of SOL to increase ETH exposure based on the positive Ethereum protocol upgrade news. The previous thesis on SOL was invalidated by network congestion reports, leading to underperformance. This move corrects that position while adhering to risk constraints."
