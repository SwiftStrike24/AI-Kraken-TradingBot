Market tone is risk-on with ETH-led breadth and XRPâ€™s legal clarity catalyzing alt rotation. To maximize alpha versus BTC/ETH, we avoid benchmark assets and rotate into stronger beta: (1) XRP as the lead catalyst trade with high relative strength and clear targets, (2) SOL for continuation toward $200+, and (3) a smaller tactical PENDLE momentum position. Total deployment is 95% to respect the 5% cash buffer, each ticket clears Kraken minimums with ample headroom. If BTC loses ~$115k or ETH <$3.7k, we would tighten risk and de-risk, but current breadth supports leaning into alt outperformance.
