Given the current bullish market sentiment and significant regulatory developments, a momentum trading strategy is appropriate. XRP's recent legal victory and subsequent price surge make it a compelling target for capitalizing on short-term momentum. By reallocating from ETH to XRP, the portfolio aims to maximize alpha in a market environment that favors assets with strong directional movement. This strategy aligns with the current market conditions, where XRP's momentum is driven by positive news catalysts and increased investor confidence.

Given the current bullish market sentiment and recent positive developments for both XRP and Ethereum, a momentum trading strategy is appropriate. XRP's recent surge due to the SEC case resolution provides a profit-taking opportunity, while Ethereum's strong daily performance and favorable news suggest continued upward momentum. Reallocating from XRP to Ethereum aligns with the strategy of capitalizing on assets with strong directional movement, aiming to maximize alpha against BTC and ETH benchmarks.

Policy and regulatory tailwinds (crypto-friendly executive actions, pro-crypto Fed pick, Ripple case resolution) have risk assets bid. While BTC >115k and ETH reclaims 3,900, ETH’s high-conviction breakout is gated at $4,000, whereas XRP’s catalyst is live and price is sustaining above the $3.26 trigger with superior momentum. To maximize alpha versus BTC/ETH under a small-portfolio single-position mandate, we rotate the portfolio from ETH into XRP (95%) to capture active momentum with a defined catalyst, retaining a 5% cash buffer for flexibility and risk control.

Market tone is bullish with BTC holding >115k and policy tailwinds, while XRP has a fresh legal catalyst (SEC case closed) and strong momentum above the 3.26 breakout, targeting 3.50–4.00 as long as 3.00 holds. To maximize alpha versus BTC/ETH under the small-portfolio single-position mandate and avoid slippage/fees from unnecessary churn, we maintain the current single-position in XRP (~95% allocation, ~5% cash). Kraken minimum order sizes make micro-rebalancing impractical without materially reducing exposure and risking momentum capture. We will reassess on pullbacks or if broader invalidation triggers emerge (e.g., BTC <112k, ETH <3,700).
