## 📊 Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Market tone is risk-on and ETH-led, with breadth improving across large caps and high-beta alts; I assess overall sentiment as bullish with ~70% confidence given ETH’s +50% 30d momentum, XRP’s regulatory overhang removal, and supportive U.S. policy headlines. Key levels: BTC is holding the 115,000 pivot (risk-on above; resistance 120,000), ETH is pressing 4,000 (support 3,750; momentum targets 4,200 then 5,000), XRP cleared the 3.26 breakout and eyes 3.50/4.00, SOL needs a firm reclaim of 180 to open 195–206 while 165 is the line to defend; secondary beta looks constructive with ADA reclaiming the 0.80 area, SUI supported near 3.50, DOGE pivoting around 0.20, while ENA is extended (+138%/30d) and BONK lags; FARTCOIN remains highly speculative—size tightly. Highest-conviction setups today: overweight ETH relative to BTC into rotation; long XRP spot with stops below 3.26, targeting 3.80–4.00; and buy SOL only on a confirmed breakout >180 for 195–206, invalidated below 165. Macro/regulatory skew is incrementally supportive (401(k) access, anti-debanking, Ripple case closure), but implementation lags and India’s tax crackdown plus tariff volatility and rising leverage (per Buterin’s overleverage warning) are near-term risks. Directionally, maintain a net-long bias and buy dips in leaders while BTC ranges; cut risk on a loss of BTC 115,000 or ETH back below 3,750, and tighten into resistance as headlines-driven momentum can fade quickly.

**🧠 Historical Reflection:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Last 3 days’ −1.95% came from execution, not thesis. You read the policy/reg tape well and tilted toward ETH/XRP appropriately. The damage was caused by churn: 10 trades on an ambiguously mapped route (XXRPZUSD), five buys and five sells that flattened exposure while paying fees and slippage. Missing stops/TPs, crossing spreads, and no pre‑trade microstructure checks compounded costs. Min‑order‑size violations produced dust and rounding errors, and absent telemetry reduced control.
Next cycle: preserve the macro edge and eliminate leaks. Trade only deep, verified USD pairs via post‑only limits. Enforce mandatory thesis_id, stop, and TP per order; size by risk (≤0.5% equity; smaller for small accounts) using ATR/invalidation. Gate entries by spread, depth, and estimated fee+slippage; reject notional < $50 and non‑compliant tick/lot sizes. Cap to two concurrent positions and six orders/day, apply a 30‑minute cooldown to prevent flip‑flops, and stop new entries once a daily fee budget is hit. Maintain healthy PnL/equity/trade logs and halt if telemetry fails. This converts correct views into PnL through disciplined execution.

Key Learnings:
- Top‑down read on policy/reg headlines; ETH/XRP tilt timely. Narrow universe (majors) reduced noise and improved fills. Best trades used post‑only limit entries near liquidity, predefined invalidation, and fewer rotations. Holding winners, not micromanaging, cut slippage. Avoiding ill‑mapped/synthetic routes and respecting tick/lot sizes minimized errors when applied.
- Execution leaks: traded ambiguous pair XXRPZUSD (mapping/synthetic risk) raising fees/slippage. Equal buys/sells neutralized exposure while paying costs. No/late stops and TPs; crossed spreads; no pre‑trade spread/depth/slippage checks. Min‑order‑size violations produced dust tickets and rounding errors. Allocation not sized by risk; over‑trading. Missing PnL/equity/trade logs blocked control. Fees + slippage, not thesis, drove the −1.95% 3‑day loss.
- HALT trading if telemetry (PnL/equity/trades) missing or stale. Pair whitelist: BTC‑USD, ETH‑USD, XRP‑USD; BLOCK /^X.*ZUSD$/ unless verified. Mandatory per‑order: thesis_id, stop, TP, size rationale. Risk per trade ≤0.5% equity using ATR/invalidation. Entry gate: post‑only; spread <5bp; top‑of‑book depth ≥10× order; est fee+slippage <15bp. Reject notional < $50 and non‑tick/lot compliant sizes. Cooldown 30m after exit; cap 2 concurrent positions, ≤6 orders/day; daily fee budget.

Recommended Focus: 1) Trade only BTC-USD, ETH-USD, XRP-USD; block /^X.*ZUSD$/. 2) Require thesis_id, stop, TP on every order. 3) Risk ≤0.5% (≤0.25% small) using stop distance; size = Risk/StopDist. 4) Post-only limits; no market orders except risk-off. 5) Gate: spread<5bp, depth≥10×order, est costs<15bp. 6) Reject notional<$50 or invalid tick/lot. 7) Max 2 positions, 6 orders/day; 30m cooldown. 8) Log pre/post trade; HALT if telemetry unhealthy. 9) Fee budget guard: stop new entries if hit. 10) No same-direction re-entry within 15m unless new signal.
