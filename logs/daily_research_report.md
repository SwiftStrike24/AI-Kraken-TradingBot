## üìä Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**

The current cryptocurrency market sentiment is bullish with a moderate confidence level, driven by positive price movements across major assets and strong institutional demand, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's price is approaching a critical resistance level at $116K, with potential to reach $118K, while Ethereum's significant 6% rise positions it as a high-conviction opportunity, supported by substantial treasury accumulation and whale activity. XRP also presents a compelling trade, breaking above $3.05 with bullish momentum despite regulatory challenges. However, macroeconomic uncertainties, such as potential impacts from U.S. tariff negotiations and fiscal policies, could introduce volatility, necessitating cautious portfolio adjustments. Overall, the directional bias remains upward, but traders should remain vigilant for any shifts in regulatory landscapes or unexpected market disruptions.
