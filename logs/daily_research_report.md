## üìä Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**

The current market landscape is characterized by a mix of cautious optimism and underlying volatility. In the crypto sector, significant attention is on Bitcoin's potential price movements, with predictions oscillating between a bullish $119K and a bearish $110K, reflecting a market grappling with uncertainty. Institutional interest remains a key driver, as evidenced by public companies expanding their crypto treasuries and firms like Bullish seeking substantial capital through IPOs. Regulatory developments, such as Coinbase's push for modernized compliance and South Korea's evolving legal framework, are pivotal, potentially influencing market dynamics and investor confidence. Overall sentiment appears neutral, with traders advised to remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors like U.S. tariffs and interest rates, which could impact broader market conditions. Opportunities exist in monitoring institutional moves and regulatory shifts, while risks include potential market corrections and geopolitical uncertainties.
