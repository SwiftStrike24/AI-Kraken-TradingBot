## 📊 Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-4o_

The cryptocurrency market sentiment today is bullish, with a high confidence level driven by significant price increases across major assets and positive news catalysts. Bitcoin's surge past $117K, bolstered by regulatory developments such as Trump's executive order allowing crypto in 401(k)s, positions it as a high-conviction trading opportunity alongside Ethereum, which is nearing $4,000 amid rising staking demand and institutional interest. Solana also presents a compelling opportunity, eyeing a breakout to $250, supported by ETF inflows and technical indicators targeting the $180 resistance level. However, macro risks such as heightened geopolitical tensions and potential tariff escalations under the Trump administration could introduce volatility, necessitating cautious portfolio positioning. Overall, the directional bias remains upward, but traders should remain vigilant for any abrupt shifts in regulatory or geopolitical landscapes that could impact market dynamics.

**🧠 Historical Reflection:**
_Model: gemini-2.5-pro_

The momentum strategy achieved an exceptional +108,500% return by concentrating a small ($9.04) portfolio on a single asset, SOLUSD. This success validates the momentum thesis but also exposes a critical failure: the allocation logic repeatedly generated non-executable orders for high-priced assets like BTC and ETH. The root cause was an over-diversification bias, inappropriate for the small capital base, and a failure to check against the exchange's minimum trade size. For small portfolios, diversification is detrimental. Future strategy must abandon it, dynamically filter the tradable universe to affordable assets, and consolidate capital into a single, high-conviction trade. Implementing strict pre-trade guardrails to check minimum order sizes is mandatory to ensure all generated trades are executable. This shift from flawed diversification to concentrated, executable trades is essential.

Key Learnings:
- Concentrating 100% of a small portfolio ($9.04) into a single, high-conviction momentum trade on SOLUSD. This focused approach bypassed the minimum order size issues that prevented trades in BTC and ETH. The high frequency and profitability of SOLUSD trades (+108,500% return) indicate the entry/exit logic for this specific pair is well-tuned. The momentum thesis proved highly effective when applied to an asset with a price point compatible with the portfolio's capital, demonstrating the power of focused execution over flawed diversification.
- The allocation logic is critically flawed for small portfolios. It repeatedly generated non-executable orders for high-priced assets like BTC (XXBTZUSD) and ETH (XETHZUSD) because calculated trade quantities were below the exchange's minimum order size. The root cause is a complete failure to check or enforce exchange-specific constraints before execution. This reflects a systemic inability to reconcile the diversification strategy with the practical limitations of the available capital, leading to failed orders and wasted alpha.
- 1. **Mandatory Pre-Trade Check:** Before any order creation, `ASSERT(calculated_quantity >= exchange.min_order_size(pair))`. 2. **Dynamic Tradable Universe:** On cycle start, filter the asset universe to only include pairs where the minimum notional trade size is less than the portfolio value. 3. **Cycle Blacklisting:** If a pre-trade check fails for a pair, blacklist it for the current trading cycle to prevent repeated failed attempts. 4. **Hard-code Minimums:** Store and regularly update exchange minimums as critical parameters.

Recommended Focus: 1. `PRE-TRADE CHECK`: Before generating a trade, verify `portfolio_value * allocation_pct >= exchange.min_notional(pair)`. Fail if false. 2. `DYNAMIC UNIVERSE`: At cycle start, create a `tradable_assets` list by filtering out any pair where `portfolio_value < exchange.min_notional(pair)`. All subsequent logic must only use this list. 3. `SINGLE-ASSET MODE`: If `portfolio_value < $1000`, activate a 'single-trade' mode. Find the top-ranked signal from `tradable_assets` and allocate 100% capital. 4. `FAILURE LOCKOUT`: If any trade execution fails due to size constraints, immediately blacklist the pair for 24 hours.
