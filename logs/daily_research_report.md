## üìä Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Crypto opens with a strong pro-risk tone after policy tailwinds (401(k) access, anti-debanking order, pro-Bitcoin Fed pick) and the SEC‚ÄìRipple case closure; overall sentiment is bullish with 75% confidence as breadth improves across majors. BTC +1.8% to 116,860 has confirmed a breakout above 115,000 (now key pivot support; deeper 113,000) with supply stacked at 120,000‚Äì125,000; hashrate ATH and miner resilience backstop dips, but we‚Äôd fade extensions into 120k and add on pullbacks. Highest-conviction longs are ETH, XRP, and SOL: ETH +5.8% at 3,887 supported by record transactions and treasury chatter‚Äîhold above 3,800 and a clean 4,000 break targets 4,200‚Äì4,400; XRP +11% at 3.31 on final legal clarity and payments M&A‚Äîsustained reclaim of 3.26 opens 3.50‚Äì3.80; SOL +3.9% at 174 continues higher lows‚Äîdefend 170 for a push to 185 then 206. Secondary beta is constructive but size modestly‚ÄîDOGE above 0.20 and ADA above 0.75 are buy-the-dip candidates; SUI‚Äôs product push underpins ~3.50 support and ENA grinds higher, while BONK/FARTCOIN remain speculative‚Äîkeep exposure minimal. Key risks today are tariff/China headlines, India‚Äôs tax enforcement, and leverage creep (per Vitalik‚Äôs warning); maintain a net-long bias with tight risk, overweight ETH/XRP/SOL versus core BTC, trail stops under ETH 3,780 / XRP 3.10 / SOL 168, and cut gross if BTC loses 115,000.

**üß† Historical Reflection:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Recent underperformance (‚àí1.72%) stems from execution, not thesis. The strategy correctly leaned into pro-crypto momentum and XRP/ETH strength, but gains were erased by churn, fees, slippage, and dust-sized orders. Trading an ambiguous pair (XXRPZUSD) likely increased costs and mapping risk. Symmetric buys and sells canceled exposure, while the absence of stops/TPs and pre-trade checks left risk unbounded. Missing PnL/equity/trade logs crippled learning and control loops. To fix: enforce telemetry health before trading; restrict to deep, verified pairs (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, XRP-USD); require thesis_id on every order; size by risk (‚â§0.5% equity) with stops set via ATR or clear invalidation; use post-only limits; and gate entries by spread, depth, and fee+slippage thresholds. For small accounts, reject notional < $50, avoid dust rounding, cap to two concurrent positions and six orders/day, and observe a daily fee budget. These guardrails preserve edge from the correct macro read while preventing execution leaks that overwhelmed performance last cycle.

Key Learnings:
- Top-down read of policy/reg headlines; timely ETH/XRP bias during favorable regime. Fewer tracked majors reduced noise. Holding periods that avoided churn tended to validate direction. Consistent thesis limited flip-flops and signal confusion.
- ‚àí1.72% over 3 days driven by execution: trading XXRPZUSD (ambiguous mapping/synthetic route) likely raised fees/slippage; symmetric buy/sell churn canceled exposure; no stop/TP; crossed spreads; no pre-trade spread/depth checks. Min-order-size violations created dust tickets and fee drag; rounding to tiny sizes worsened fills. No PnL/equity/trade logs broke feedback loops.
- Whitelist deep pairs only (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, XRP-USD). Block symbols matching ^X.*ZUSD$ unless explicitly mapped/fee-checked. Trade only if logging=OK and thesis_id attached. Pre-trade: spread ‚â§10 bps, depth within 10 bps ‚â•10√ó order size, est. fee+slip ‚â§20 bps. Use post-only limits; no market orders except stops. Always place stop/TP on entry at ‚àí1R/+2R.

Recommended Focus: 1) HALT if logs/PnL not recording. 2) ALLOW=['BTC-USD','ETH-USD','XRP-USD']; BLOCK /^X.*ZUSD$/ unless mapped. 3) REQUIRE thesis_id per order. 4) Size=min(RiskPerTrade/StopDist, depth_cap); RiskPerTrade=0.5% eq. 5) Reject notional<$50 or below min tick/step. 6) Pre-trade: spread‚â§10bps, depth‚â•10x size, fee+slip‚â§20bps. 7) Post-only limit; avoid crossing spread. 8) Stop via ATR(14)*1.5 or structure; TP=2R. 9) One active order/asset; ‚â§2 amend/30m. 10) Daily caps: ‚â§2 positions, ‚â§6 orders.
