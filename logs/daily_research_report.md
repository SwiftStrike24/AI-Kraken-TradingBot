## üìä Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**

The current cryptocurrency market sentiment is cautiously bullish, with a confidence level of moderate, driven by positive price action in Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), which have shown gains of 2.50% and 2.92% respectively. Ethereum's recent accumulation by large treasuries and Solana's strategic expansion into mobile devices suggest strong institutional interest, making them high-conviction trading opportunities. Critical price levels to watch include Bitcoin's (BTC) support at $113,000 and resistance at $118,000, while Ethereum's potential breakout could trap bears if it sustains above $3,650. Macro risks include potential regulatory shifts as US regulators intensify their focus on crypto compliance, which could introduce volatility. For risk management, maintain a bullish bias on ETH and SOL, while closely monitoring BTC's price action for any signs of a reversal.
