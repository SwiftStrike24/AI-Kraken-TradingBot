## üìä Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**

The current market sentiment is bearish with a moderate confidence level, as evidenced by the widespread price declines across the top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are down 0.90% and 3.15%, respectively. Despite the negative price action, XRP presents a high-conviction trading opportunity due to its recent partnership with BDACS and support from a Korean crypto custodian, which could bolster its adoption and liquidity. Additionally, the SEC's clarification on liquid staking tokens is a positive development for Ethereum, potentially setting the stage for future gains once the market stabilizes. Critical price levels to watch include Bitcoin's support at $110,000 and Ethereum's resistance at $3,700, which, if breached, could signal further downside. Macro and regulatory risks, such as the ongoing economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions, could exacerbate market volatility, necessitating cautious portfolio positioning. Traders should maintain a defensive stance, focusing on risk management and monitoring for any shifts in regulatory guidance that could impact market dynamics.
