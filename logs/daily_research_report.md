## üìä Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Market tone is cautiously bullish (65% confidence) with ETH leading breadth (+3.8% 24h, +46% 30d) and alt rotation accelerating as BTC dominance slips, supported by incremental institutional adoption (Harvard‚Äôs ~$116M IBIT stake) and regulated access headlines (SUI via Swiss banks), while BTC consolidates (-0.5% 24h) near highs. Technically, BTC is range-bound 114k‚Äì118k with 120k a pivot to 123‚Äì125k and supports at 114k/112k; ETH has broken above 4k with a 4.25‚Äì4.40k objective and pullback support at 3.90‚Äì3.95k; SOL is constructive with a 185‚Äì190 squeeze zone; DOGE momentum builds above 0.22 toward 0.25‚Äì0.27; ADA grinds higher with 0.82‚Äì0.85 resistance; XRP at 3.30 shows mixed signals (ETF rumor quashed, on-chain caution) with 3.05‚Äì3.10 support. Highest conviction setups: long ETH on strength toward 4.4k (risk to 3.90k), long SUI on a clean hold above 4.00 targeting 4.30‚Äì4.50 (risk to 3.70), and momentum long DOGE on closes above 0.23/0.235 targeting 0.26 (risk to 0.218); consider SOL add-ons on a break/close over 185, while ENA (+125% 30d) is extended and better bought on 10‚Äì15% pullbacks. Maintain underweights in BONK and FARTCOIN given shallow liquidity and fading breadth, treat XRP as a trading vehicle rather than core overweight until metrics improve, and keep ADA as lower-beta beta-capture above 0.75‚Äì0.76 support. Macro/regulatory watch: tariff rhetoric and safe-haven rotation (gold outpacing BTC YTD), geopolitical headlines (Trump‚ÄìPutin), and compliance actions (e.g., Paxos fine) can jar risk; directional bias is modest net-long and alt-tilted versus BTC with tight stops, add on ETH/SOL strength, and hedge if BTC loses 114k or ETH fails back below 4k.

**üß† Historical Reflection:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Portfolio down 0.58% over 3 days across 34 trades, SOL-heavy with a consistent alt-rotation thesis. Edge appeared when trading majors (ETH/SOL) via spot, using limit-at-queue entries, partial profit-taking, low concurrency, and paced orders‚Äîcontaining slippage and errors while aligning with ETH-led strength. Losses clustered around micro tickets near venue minimums (fee drag, rejects, dust), Kraken X*/Z* pair-name mismaps that impaired routing/quotes/logging, missing OCO stops and absent liquidity gates, SUI headline-chasing, buy-skew churn, and allocation drift that weakened BTC/ETH ballast. Occasional logging latency showed zero equity, obscuring risk. Biases: action bias, buy-the-dip in SOL, headline/novelty chasing, unit-size bias, confirmation/recency, and operational neglect on symbol hygiene. Next cycle, enforce small-account guardrails: risk 1%/trade with OCO (1R/2R), daily kill at -2% or -3R and weekly -5%, whitelist only standard USD spot pairs (block Kraken X*/Z*), apply strict liquidity gates (spread<=0.2%, depth>=20x, impact<=0.1%), fee-aware minimum ticket sizing with batching, limit concurrency and order cadence, maintain BTC+ETH>=40% when >2 assets, avoid headline trades unless R>=1.8, log fills within 10 minutes, and sweep dust weekly.

Key Learnings:
- Trading majors (ETH/SOL) with tight spreads; spot-only. Limit-at-queue entries reduced slippage/fees. Trims into strength crystallized gains and lowered drawdown. Low concurrency (<=3) and >=15m spacing cut execution/ops errors. Avoiding market orders helped. Larger, fee-aware tickets improved efficiency. Alignment with ETH-led rotation supported relative resilience.
- Micro tickets near venue min inflated fees, caused rejects/partials, and created dust. Kraken X*/Z* pair-name mapping issues (XETHZUSD, XXRPZUSD, XXBTZUSD, XDGUSD) led to routing/quote/logging mismatches. Missing OCO stops and absent liquidity gates increased slippage. SUI headline-chasing and buy-skew churn. Allocation drift thinned BTC/ETH ballast. Logging latency showed zero equity briefly. Inconsistent min-ticket policy.
- Risk 1%/trade with attached OCO (1R SL, 2R TP). Daily kill at -2% or -3R; weekly pause at -5%. Whitelist standard USD spot pairs; block Kraken X*/Z* codes. Liquidity gate: spread<=0.2%, depth>=20x order, est. impact<=0.1%. Min ticket>=max(1.2x venue min, 50x fees, $25); else batch/skip. Concurrency<=3, <=2 new orders/day, >=15m spacing. Keep BTC+ETH>=40% when >2 assets. Log fills<10m; sweep dust weekly.

Recommended Focus: 1) Risk=1%/trade, OCO 1R SL/2R TP. 2) Kill: -2% day or -3R; -5% week pause. 3) Trade only standard USD spot pairs; block XETHZUSD/XXRPZUSD/XXBTZZUSD/XDGUSD. 4) Liquidity gate: spread<=0.2%, depth>=20x size, impact<=0.1%. 5) Min ticket>=max(1.2x venue min, 50x fees, $25); batch/skip otherwise. 6) Concurrency<=3; <=2 new orders/day; >=15m spacing. 7) Limit-at-queue only; no market orders. 8) Maintain BTC+ETH>=40% when >2 assets. 9) No headline trades unless R>=1.8 and gates pass. 10) Log fills<10m; weekly dust sweep.
