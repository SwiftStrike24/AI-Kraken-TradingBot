## üìä Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**

The cryptocurrency market is exhibiting a cautiously bullish sentiment today, with a confidence level of moderate strength, as most top assets show positive price movements. Bitcoin, despite a recent sell-off by long-term holders, has stabilized at $114,801, suggesting a potential support level around $114K, while Ethereum's 2.47% rise to $3,672.13 indicates strong buying interest, making it a high-conviction opportunity alongside Solana, which has surged 3.48% to $167.85. XRP's upcoming escrow unlock could introduce volatility, but its current upward momentum at $2.99 suggests resilience. The absence of macro or regulatory news today reduces external risk factors, allowing traders to focus on technical patterns and price action. For risk management, maintaining a close watch on Bitcoin's support levels and Ethereum's resistance around $3,700 is crucial, as these will guide directional bias and portfolio adjustments.
