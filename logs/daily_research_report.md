## 📊 Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Market tone is moderately bullish (65% confidence) with rotation into large-cap alts as ETH leads (+45% 30d) and BTC steadies; Harvard’s $116M IBIT stake and Swiss banks expanding regulated SUI access reinforce institutional bid while BTC dominance eases. Key levels: BTC 115k support and 118.5k–120k resistance; ETH holding 4,000 sets a measured move toward 4,400 with 3,800 support; SOL needs a decisive close above 180 to unlock 200–220; DOGE 0.20/0.25 and XRP 3.10/3.50 frame ranges, with SUI 3.60 support and 4.00 resistance. Highest-conviction setups: long ETH on sustained >4,000 for 4,350–4,400 (risk to 3,820), long SOL on break/close >180 for 200–220 (risk to 168), and accumulate SUI on pullbacks to 3.60–3.70 for 4.10–4.30 (risk to 3.45). Macro/reg watch: tariff/geopolitics headlines could dampen risk while gold competes as a haven; enforcement actions (e.g., Paxos fine) and HK stablecoin licensing may redirect flows regionally, offset by on-chain tailwinds from Coinbase’s DEX routing. Directional bias: selectively add risk in ETH/SOL/SUI, keep BTC neutral-weight with trailing stops, and fade extended beta (ENA +125% 30d, BONK/FARTCOIN) into strength; flip defensive below BTC 115k or ETH 3.8k.

**🧠 Historical Reflection:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Performance slipped (-2.77%, 3 days) across 49 trades skewed to SOLUSD buys. Losses clustered when the process drifted: micro tickets near/under venue minimums inflated fees, generated rejects and dust; Kraken X*/Z* pair aliases (XETHZUSD, XXBTZUSD, XDGUSD, XXRPZUSD) impaired routing/quotes and logging; stops were absent; liquidity gates were ignored; SUI news-chasing and frequent SOL flips raised turnover while BTC+ETH ballast fell below 40%, amplifying beta. When the system stayed in USD spot majors (ETH/SOL), entered passively at queue, used OCO with 1R stops/2R targets, staged trims, kept concurrency low, and sized tickets to dominate fees, results were materially better; ETH strength provided resilience. Next cycle: whitelist BTCUSD/ETHUSD/SOLUSD; normalize symbols and block aliases; risk 1%/trade via OCO; enforce kill-switches (-2% day or -3R; -5% week); apply liquidity gates (spread<=0.2%, depth>=20x size, impact<=0.1%); minimum ticket>=max(1.2x venue min, 50x fees, $25) else batch; concurrency<=3 with >=15m spacing and <=2 new orders/day; maintain BTC+ETH>=40%; limit-only execution; log fills within 10 minutes and sweep dust weekly; ignore news trades unless expected R>=1.8.

Key Learnings:
- USD spot majors (ETH/SOL); limit-at-queue maker entries; predefined OCO (SL=1R, TP=2R); staged trims into strength; low concurrency (<=3) with >=15m spacing; batched tickets sized to dominate fees (>=max(1.2x venue min, 50x fees, $25)); BTC+ETH ballast >=40% to damp beta; avoiding long-tail alts reduced slippage/rejects; ETH relative strength added resilience.
- Micro orders at/under venue minimums bloated fees, caused rejects/partials, and created dust. Kraken pair-name aliases (XETHZUSD, XXBTZUSD, XDGUSD, XXRPZUSD) broke routing, quotes, and analytics. Missing OCO stops and absent liquidity gates (spread/depth/impact) left losses unmanaged. News-chasing SUI churn and frequent SOL flips raised turnover. BTC+ETH ballast <40% increased beta. Too many new orders/day.
- Whitelist BTCUSD/ETHUSD/SOLUSD (spot, USD). Normalize symbols; block X*/Z* aliases. Risk 1%/trade via auto OCO (SL=1R, TP=2R). Day kill: -2% or -3R; week: -5%. Liquidity gates: spread<=0.2%, depth>=20x size, impact<=0.1%. Min ticket>=max(1.2x venue min, 50x fees, $25) else batch. Concurrency<=3; >=15m spacing; <=2 new orders/day. BTC+ETH>=40%. Limit-only. Log fills<10m; weekly dust sweep.

Recommended Focus: 1. Trade only BTCUSD/ETHUSD/SOLUSD (spot). 2. Normalize Kraken symbols; block X*/Z* aliases. 3. Risk=1%/trade; auto OCO SL=1R, TP=2R. 4. Min ticket>=max(1.2x venue min, 50x fees, $25); else batch. 5. Liquidity gates: spread<=0.2%, depth>=20x size, impact<=0.1%. 6. Concurrency<=3; >=15m between entries; <=2 new orders/day. 7. Portfolio: BTC+ETH>=40%; any alt<=35%. 8. Limit-at-queue only; no market orders. 9. Trim into strength; do not chase misses. 10. Kill: day -2% or -3R; week -5%. 11. Log fills<10m; weekly dust sweep. 12. News trades only if expected R>=1.8 and gates pass.
