## 📊 Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Market tone is bullish with 70% confidence as alt rotation accelerates (ETH +5%/24h above $4,000, XRP/DOGE bid, BTC lagging), aided by constructive headlines (Coinbase in-app DEX, Trump pro-crypto stance, Ripple fundraising greenlight) and supportive macro (JPMorgan now flags four Fed cuts). Highest-conviction longs: ETH for momentum continuation toward $4,400 (hidden-signal narrative) while holding $3,850–$3,900, and SUI on institutional adoption (Swiss bank custody/trading) targeting a break of $4.20 with risk defined at ~$3.50; a third is SOL on strong structure and upcoming Coinbase app Solana support, with a break above $185 opening $200–$210 while $170 holds. Key levels today: BTC pivot $115k–$118k (break >$118k reopens $120k+, support ~$112k), ETH $4,000 reclaimed with $4,400 resistance, SOL $185/$170, XRP resistance ~$3.50 (ETF-rumor denial caps upside) with $3.00 support, DOGE $0.25/$0.21, SUI $4.20/$3.50, and note ENA is extended (+132% 30d) with mean-reversion risk below ~$0.58. Macro/regulatory risks include tariff headlines and ongoing enforcement (Paxos/NYDFS) that can spike cross-asset volatility, while BTC dominance slippage warns of crowded alt exposure; position sizing and optionality are warranted. Directional bias: maintain net-long alt exposure versus BTC, buy dips in ETH/SUI/SOL with tight stops at stated supports, and limit meme/froth (ENA/BONK/FARTCOIN) to tactical momentum trades with strict risk controls.

**🧠 Historical Reflection:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Last 3 days delivered a modest +0.30% with 19 spot trades, concentrated in SOL and other majors under a consistent thesis. What worked: majors focus kept spreads tight; SOL/ETH beta aided gains; spot-only and low concurrency reduced risk and errors; selective limit orders improved entry quality. What failed: tiny, near-minimum tickets created fee drag and dust; frequent use of nonstandard Kraken pair names (XXRPZUSD, XETHZUSD, XDGUSD) introduced routing/quote risk and logging confusion; missing OCO stops and absent liquidity gates increased slippage and delayed exits; an alt-heavy tilt underweighted BTC/ETH ballast; buy-skew and news-chasing (SUI) appeared; logging lag produced an equity zero spike. Next cycle: enforce mechanical guardrails—risk ≤1%/trade with OCO (2R/1R), daily kill at −2% or −3R and weekly pause at −5%. Trade only standard USD spot pairs on a whitelist; block X*/Z* codes. Require ticket ≥ max(1.2× venue min, 50× fees, $25). Gate entries by spread ≤0.5%, estimated slippage ≤0.3%, and 1% depth ≥5× order. Cap concurrency (≤3), pace orders (≤2/day, ≥15m apart), and keep BTC+ETH ≥40% when >2 holdings. Log fills within 10 minutes and sweep dust weekly.

Key Learnings:
- Majors focus kept spreads manageable; SOL/ETH beta captured upside. Limit entries (when used) improved execution vs crossing. Spot-only avoided leverage/liquidation risk. Low concurrency reduced errors. Consistent thesis limited whipsaw. Timely DOGE exits contained risk. Net positive despite small account and fees.
- Hugging minimum order sizes caused rejects/partials, high fee ratio, and dust. Nonstandard Kraken pair names (XXRPZUSD, XETHZUSD, XDGUSD) risked misroutes/bad quotes and muddled logs. Missing immediate OCO stops led to late exits/slippage. No liquidity gate (spread/slip/depth). Alt-heavy drift underweighted BTC/ETH ballast. Buy-skew and micro-notionals increased fee drag. Logging lag (equity 0.0) hurt auditability.
- Risk≤1%/trade; target R≥2. Daily kill −2% or −3R; weekly pause −5%. Whitelist USD spot: BTCUSD, ETHUSD, SOLUSD, XRPUSD, PENDLEUSD, DOGEUSD; others only if pass liquidity gate; block X*/Z* Kraken codes. Ticket ≥max(1.2× venue min, 50× fees, $25). Liquidity gate: spread ≤0.5%, est slip ≤0.3%, 1% depth ≥5× order. Entry via limit + OCO (TP≈2R, SL=1R). Max 3 positions; ≤2 new orders/day; ≥15m spacing. BTC+ETH ≥40% if >2 holdings. Log fills ≤10m; sweep dust weekly.

Recommended Focus: 1) Risk per trade ≤1% equity via stop-based sizing; target R≥2. 2) OCO at entry: SL=1R, TP≈2R; no averaging down. 3) Whitelist: BTCUSD, ETHUSD, SOLUSD, XRPUSD, PENDLEUSD, DOGEUSD; reject nonstandard X*/Z* codes. 4) Ticket ≥max(1.2× venue min, 50× fees, $25). 5) Liquidity gate: spread ≤0.5%, est slip ≤0.3%, 1% depth ≥5× order. 6) Max 3 open; ≤2 new/day; ≥15m spacing. 7) Maintain BTC+ETH ≥40% when >2 holdings. 8) Retry a rejected order once, else cancel. 9) Log fills ≤10m; weekly dust sweep. 10) Daily kill at −2% or −3R; weekly pause at −5%.
