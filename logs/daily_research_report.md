## 📊 Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Market tone is moderately bullish (65% confidence) as alt leadership broadens—ETH up 14% 7d/46% 30d and DOGE/ADA/XRP firm—supported by fresh institutional flows (Harvard’s $116M into IBIT), regulated on-ramps (Swiss banks opening SUI, Coinbase in-app DEX routing), and July’s $2.67B funding, while BTC consolidates (-0.35% 24h) as dominance slips. Highest conviction: long ETH on sustained reclaim above $4,000 targeting $4,200–$4,400 (risk below $3,900), long SOL on a breakout through $180 toward $195–$200 (risk below $171–$172), and long SUI while it holds $3.70 with $4.20–$4.50 in play (risk below $3.55); ENA is extended (+124% 30d) and better treated as a momentum trade with tight stops. Key levels/patterns: BTC coiling in a $115k–$118k box—close above $118k opens $121k/$125k, below $115k risks $112k; XRP is stretched at $3.29 with $3.00 support and $3.50 supply after ETF rumor denial and a flashing caution metric; DOGE constructive above $0.20 with $0.24–$0.25 resistance; ADA steady above $0.75 with $0.82–$0.85 cap; BONK rangebound and FARTCOIN defending $1.00 pivot. Macro/regulatory risk skew is two-sided: tariff-war headlines and gold’s safe-haven bid could cap beta, while potential 401(k) access to crypto, HK stablecoin licensing efforts, and ongoing institutional allocations underpin dips; AML enforcement (Paxos) and geopolitics (Trump–Putin meeting) are headline shock risks. Directionally, maintain a net-long bias tilted to ETH/SOL/SUI, add on strength through the cited triggers, and hedge or cut gross if BTC loses $115k or ETH falls back below $3,900.

**🧠 Historical Reflection:**
_Model: OpenAI GPT-5_

Recent performance (-3.07%, 3 days) reflects process drift: 53 trades clustered in SOL, SUI headline-chasing, micro-sized tickets near venue minimums, and Kraken alias pairs that broke routing and analytics. Risk controls were thin—no OCO stops and no liquidity gates—while BTC+ETH ballast fell below 40%, amplifying beta. Conversely, when the system stayed in USD spot majors, entered passively at queue, used OCO (1R/2R), staged trims, and kept concurrency low with fee-dominant sizing, results stabilized; ETH’s relative strength provided resilience. To prevent repeat errors, tighten scope and enforce machine-runnable guardrails: whitelist BTCUSD/ETHUSD/SOLUSD; normalize symbols and block X*/Z* aliases; risk 1%/trade via auto OCO; apply liquidity gates (spread<=0.2%, depth>=20x size, impact<=0.1%); size tickets to exceed fee floors; keep concurrency<=3 with >=15m spacing and <=2 new orders/day; maintain BTC+ETH>=40%; limit-only execution; kill-switch at -2% day/-3R or -5% week; log fills within 10 minutes and sweep dust weekly; ignore news trades unless expected R>=1.8. These concrete, small-account-aware rules convert the alt-rotation thesis into disciplined, low-friction execution that prioritizes edge over activity.

Key Learnings:
- USD spot majors (ETH/SOL, some BTC); limit maker entries at queue; OCO (1R SL, 2R TP); staged trims into strength; low concurrency (<=3) with >=15m spacing; tickets sized to dominate fees; BTC+ETH ballast >=40% to damp beta. ETH relative strength added resilience. Limit-only reduced slippage; disciplined rebalancing toward majors improved consistency.
- Micro orders at/under venue minimums inflated fees, caused rejects/partials, and created dust. Kraken pair-name aliases (XETHZUSD, XXBTZUSD, XDGUSD, XXRPZUSD) broke routing/quotes/logging. No OCO stops and no spread/depth/impact gates. SUI news-chasing and rapid SOL churn raised turnover without edge. BTC+ETH ballast <40% amplified beta. Too many new orders/day; delayed logging impaired feedback.
- Whitelist BTCUSD/ETHUSD/SOLUSD. Normalize symbols; block X*/Z* aliases. Risk 1%/trade via auto OCO (1R SL, 2R TP). Kill: day -2% or -3R; week -5%. Liquidity gates: spread<=0.2%, depth>=20x size, impact<=0.1%. Min ticket>=max(1.2x venue min, 50x fees, $25) else batch. Concurrency<=3; >=15m spacing; <=2 new orders/day. Limit-only; log fills<10m; weekly dust sweep.

Recommended Focus: 1) Trade spot BTCUSD/ETHUSD/SOLUSD only; limit-at-queue. 2) Normalize symbols; block XETHZUSD/XXBTZUSD/XDGUSD/XXRPZUSD and all X*/Z*. 3) Risk 1%/trade; OCO SL=1R, TP=2R. 4) Gates: spread<=0.2%, depth>=20x size, impact<=0.1%. 5) Size>=max(1.2x venue min, 50x fees, $25) or batch. 6) BTC+ETH>=40%; any single alt<=35%. 7) Concurrency<=3; >=15m spacing; <=2 new orders/day. 8) Kill: day -2% or -3R; week -5% (flat/pause 24h). 9) Trim into strength; don’t chase misses. 10) News trades only if expected R>=1.8 and gates pass. 11) Log fills/PNL <10m; reconcile symbols; sweep dust weekly. 12) No market orders; reject orders that create <$1 dust.
