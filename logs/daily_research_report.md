## üìä Market Context
**AI-Generated Market Analysis:**

The cryptocurrency market sentiment today leans bullish with a moderate confidence level, driven by positive price movements across major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, which have all shown gains. Bitcoin, currently priced at $114,762, is navigating a low-liquidity "air gap" between $110k and $116k, suggesting potential volatility but also opportunities for breakout trades. Ethereum's 2.35% rise to $3,669.65, despite concerns over Layer 2 fee structures, presents a high-conviction opportunity, especially with ongoing discussions around EIP-7999 potentially reshaping its fee dynamics. Solana, up 2.84% to $167.54, also stands out as a strong candidate for momentum trading, supported by its robust technical setup. On the macro front, geopolitical tensions and new tariffs from the Trump administration could introduce volatility, necessitating cautious portfolio adjustments. Overall, the directional bias remains cautiously optimistic, with a focus on managing risk through strategic entry and exit points around key technical levels.
