# ChatGPT-Kraken Portfolio Bot — Initial Implementation

## 🧠 Concept

A fully autonomous crypto trading bot powered by ChatGPT 4o.
It runs daily at 07:00 AM MST, evaluates the market, and rebalances a portfolio of Kraken-listed tokens with the goal of generating consistent alpha vs BTC and ETH.
The strategy is experimental, transparent, and performance-logged.

## 🔧 Recent Architecture Improvements (August 2025)

### Asset Pair Handling
- **Problem Solved:** "Unknown asset pair" errors when querying prices for assets in account balance
- **Solution:** `KrakenAPI` now fetches all valid trading pairs on initialization and creates a mapping from assets to their correct USD pair names
- **Benefits:** Eliminates guesswork, prevents API errors, supports all tradeable assets on Kraken

### Configuration Loading
- **Problem Solved:** Environment variables loaded inconsistently across modules
- **Solution:** Centralized `.env` loading at the top of `scheduler.py` before any imports
- **Benefits:** Predictable startup sequence, eliminates race conditions

### Robust Error Handling
- **Enhanced logging:** Added detailed logs showing which assets are found and which valid pairs are being used
- **Graceful degradation:** Assets without USD pairs are logged but don't crash the system
- **Fallback mechanisms:** Asset pair fetching failures fall back gracefully

### Unicode/Encoding Fix
- **Problem Solved:** Unicode decode errors when reading prompt templates and thesis files on Windows
- **Solution:** Explicitly specify UTF-8 encoding for all file operations
- **Benefits:** Cross-platform compatibility, handles emoji and special characters in files

### Fiat Currency & Forex Handling
- **Problem Solved:** Bot was trying to find USD/CHF prices for USD balances and including forex pairs
- **Solution:** 
  - Treat USD/USDC/USDT as cash at $1.00 per unit (no price lookup needed)
  - Filter out forex currencies (CAD, EUR, GBP, etc.) from crypto trading pairs
  - Exclude forex assets from equity calculations but log them for transparency
- **Benefits:** Accurate portfolio valuation, cleaner logs, no spurious API calls for forex pairs

### AI Research Agent Integration (August 2025)
- **Problem Solved:** Decision engine was operating in a "portfolio vacuum" without real-world market context
- **Solution:** Added comprehensive research agent that gathers market intelligence before each trading decision
- **Features:**
  - RSS feed aggregation from major crypto news sources (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, The Block, etc.)
  - Macroeconomic and regulatory news from **full political spectrum** for balanced analysis:
    - **Centrist/Unbiased:** MarketWatch (financial news leader)
    - **Conservative/Right-leaning:** National Review, Reason Magazine, AEI, Manhattan Institute, Mises Institute  
    - **Liberal/Left-leaning:** NPR (News, All Things Considered, Planet Money), Washington Post Business, Mother Jones
  - **Balanced approach:** AI receives perspectives from all major political viewpoints to make truly informed decisions
  - **AI-Powered Market Analysis:** OpenAI GPT-4o synthesizes all gathered headlines into actionable market insights
    - Identifies key market themes and sentiment
    - Highlights regulatory and macroeconomic factors
    - Provides specific opportunities and risks for traders
    - Professional-grade analysis comparable to financial research firms
  - Intelligent keyword-based content filtering
  - Caching system to prevent duplicate processing
  - Robust error handling with graceful degradation
  - Daily research reports saved for audit trail
- **Benefits:** AI now makes trading decisions with awareness of current market events, regulatory changes, and sentiment

### Market Intelligence Pipeline
- **Stable Data Sources:** Prioritizes RSS feeds over web scraping for reliability
- **Smart Filtering:** Uses crypto and macro keyword filtering to surface relevant content
- **Rate Limiting:** Respectful request timing to avoid IP blocks
- **Error Resilience:** Individual source failures don't crash the entire research process
- **Structured Output:** Generates clean, markdown-formatted reports for AI consumption

### Advanced Prompt Engineering Architecture (August 2025)
- **Problem Solved:** Monolithic prompt building was brittle and hard to maintain
- **Solution:** Dedicated `PromptEngine` module with template-based architecture
- **Key Features:**
  - **Professional Template System:** XML-tagged prompt structure for clarity and consistency
  - **Intelligent Truncation:** Smart research report truncation preserving header and recent content
  - **Performance Feedback Loop:** Infrastructure for thesis accuracy tracking (V2 enhancement)
  - **Comprehensive Logging:** All prompts logged with timestamps for debugging and audit
  - **Future-Proofing:** Ready for OpenAI tool use and function calling integration
- **Benefits:** Improved prompt reliability, better AI responses, easier maintenance and iteration

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation (August 2025)

### Revolutionary Architecture Upgrade

The trading bot has been upgraded from a monolithic pipeline to a sophisticated multi-agent system based on the latest research in AI coordination and cognitive architecture. This upgrade addresses the key challenges identified in modern multi-agent literature.

**Key Principles Implemented:**
- **Centralized Orchestration**: The Supervisor-AI ensures shared context and prevents agent fragmentation
- **Cognitive Transparency**: Every agent logs its complete thought process for audit and debugging
- **Specialized Intelligence**: Each agent focuses on a specific cognitive task with deep expertise
- **Robust Error Handling**: Individual agent failures don't crash the entire system
- **Context Preservation**: All agents operate with shared context to maintain coherent decision-making

### Agent Specifications

| Agent | Role | Cognitive Function | Input | Output |
|-------|------|-------------------|-------|--------|
| **Supervisor-AI** | Central Orchestrator | Pipeline management, final validation, trade approval | Initial cycle trigger | Complete execution results |
| **Analyst-AI** | Market Intelligence | News aggregation, sentiment analysis, trend identification | Research directives | Structured intelligence report |
| **Strategist-AI** | Prompt Engineering | Context assembly, prompt optimization, strategy formulation | Intelligence + portfolio data | Optimized AI prompt payload |
| **Trader-AI** | AI Execution | OpenAI API calls, response parsing, quality assessment | Prompt payload | Validated trading plan |

### Communication Protocol

All inter-agent communication follows a standardized JSON format with complete audit trails and cognitive transparency logging.

### Cognitive Logging System

Each agent maintains complete cognitive transparency through timestamped transcript files in `logs/agent_transcripts/{YYYY-MM-DD}/`.

### Pipeline State Management

The Supervisor-AI manages pipeline execution through well-defined states: IDLE → RUNNING_ANALYST → RUNNING_STRATEGIST → RUNNING_TRADER → REVIEWING_PLAN → EXECUTING_TRADES → COMPLETED.

### Quality Assurance & Validation

The multi-agent system implements comprehensive quality controls at each stage with metrics for intelligence quality, strategy confidence, decision quality, and risk assessment.

### Deployment Instructions

**New Production Scheduler:**
```bash
python scheduler_multiagent.py
```

**Demo and Testing:**
```bash
python run_multiagent_demo.py
```

**Single Demo Run:**
```bash
python scheduler_multiagent.py demo
```

### Migration from Legacy System

The new multi-agent system maintains backward compatibility while providing enhanced capabilities:
- Legacy modules remain functional during transition
- Enhanced cognitive transparency and audit trails
- Improved error handling and resilience
- Better AI decision quality through specialized agents
